    "### Objective: \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective for this project was to understand the major skills and requirements in current Intelligence Analysis jobs.  We achieved this by exploring various python libraries to display the  job data we collected through visualizations.  These visualizations helped us interpret all of the data we collected and compare the relationships between certain variables.  The results of this project will help us prepare for our future careers in Intelligence Analysis.\n"

    "### Methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we gathered was from Indeed.com which was easily accessible and informative.  We made a point to only include jobs that provided information on all of the categories we were looking at in order to ensure consistent and accurate data. If there was no salary listed, then we used outside research to find that information.  Also, we sorted the column, “posted date” from lowest to highest to help us later on in our visualizations.\n",

This is not surprising, however, since our pool of data was relatively small. The most common job postings were from \"Booz Allen Hamilton,\" \"General Dynamics Information Technology,\" and \"BAE Systems.\" Although we only recorded two, these companies had many postings on Indeed as compared with other companies/agencies.

The Counter function ordered these dates by highest frequency, but the line plot displayed it based on chronological order. We sorted the dates manually in the excel document to display plot properly. The graph shows that the March and mid-April were the months that had the highest amount of job posts. Also November had three postings. It should be noted that there were only postings in November, March, and April -- the line chart just displayed the icreasing trend."

This scatter plot helped us visualize the trends between these two variables.  Most of the data points were heavily concentrated on the lower ends of each axis.  The other data points were more spread out, however it was evident that there was a positive correlation between years of experience and minimal salaries.  In the future, we could code a line of best fit to display on the scatterplot, in order to make interpreting the data on the plot much easier and faster."

The FTTTF supports FBI field operations by conducting bulk and targeted data analyses. Duties and responsibilities include: - Selects, abstracts, or excerpts data from specific sources and compiles them; - Evaluates and makes preliminary analyses of raw intelligence data in items of such factors as adequacy of detail and coverage - Maintains files of raw or abstracted data - Provides services that seek, capture, consolidate, and synthesize locally relevant data to create and maintain baseline domain awareness for the FBI's area of responsibility, including observed and potential threat components, indicators, vulnerabilities, and domain intelligence gaps - Develops and maintains source identification products - Receives and analyzes information assessing office collection capabilities against the FBI's priority criminal and national security threats, indicators and/or gaps\n",

      "Work involves providing current intelligence counterterrorism support to the intel, military and law enforcement communities. Customers are analysts and operators. IntelCenter does not provide policy support or work in any aspect of the political arena. Four core areas of work within the terrorist to rebel group spectrum are targeting, tactics, operational aspects and messaging (including videos and threat statements). Analysts work directly with operator and analytical communities at intelligence agencies, military and law enforcement in more than 30 countries. Analyst responsibilities are specific to assigned accounts which are geographic, group or specialty focused. Analysts typically have accounts in all three categories. Watch Officer responsibilities require an awareness of activity worldwide and the significance of developments even outside of assigned accounts. Work is focused on impact. For example an analytical product with the complexity equivalent of 1+1 that assists in a takedown or interdiction is valued over a doctoral thesis that has little to no relevance to operational activity or current threat assessments. We stress impact, not an academic approach.\n",

Customers are analysts and operators. IntelCenter does not provide policy support or work in any aspect of the political arena. Four core areas of work within the terrorist to rebel group spectrum are targeting, tactics, operational aspects and messaging (including videos and threat statements). Analysts work directly with operator and analytical communities at intelligence agencies, military and law enforcement in more than 30 countries. Analyst responsibilities are specific to assigned accounts which are geographic, group or specialty focused. Analysts typically have accounts in all three categories. Watch Officer responsibilities require an awareness of activity worldwide and the significance of developments even outside of assigned accounts. Work is focused on impact. For example an analytical product with the complexity equivalent of 1+1 that assists in a takedown or interdiction is valued over a doctoral thesis that has little to no relevance to operational activity or current threat assessments. We stress impact, not an academic approach.As a Political Analyst for the CIA, you will support policymakers by producing and delivering written and oral assessments of the domestic politics, foreign policy, stability, and social issues of foreign governments and entities. Your analysis will examine these actors' goals and motivations, culture, values, history, society, decision making processes, and ideologies in the context of how those elements affect US interests and national security.The mission of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Counterterrorism Division's (CTD) Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force (FTTTF) is to provide information that helps keep both individuals and their supporters who may pose threats to national security out of the U.S. or leads to their removal, detention, prosecution, or other legal action. The FTTTF supports FBI field operations by conducting bulk and targeted data analyses. Duties and responsibilities include: - Selects, abstracts, or excerpts data from specific sources and compiles them; - Evaluates and makes preliminary analyses of raw intelligence data in items of such factors as adequacy of detail and coverage - Maintains files of raw or abstracted data - Provides services that seek, capture, consolidate, and synthesize locally relevant data to create and maintain baseline domain awareness for the FBI's area of responsibility, including observed and potential threat components, indicators, vulnerabilities, and domain intelligence gaps - Develops and maintains source identification products - Receives and analyzes information assessing office collection capabilities against the FBI's priority criminal and national security threats, indicators and/or gapsSupporting the cycle of collection, processing, analysis, production, and/or dissemination of intelligence information in accordance with the National Intelligence Priorities Framework.\n",

    "Throughout this project, we noticed several relationships between the variables we analyzed.  For example, the variable “years experience” was strongly correlated to the variable “minimal salary.”  Also, there was a trend found in the locations of the jobs because they were all heavily concentrated in Northern Virginia.  Because this is a qualitative trend and not quantitative, it had to be interpreted by reading the bar graph.  The only locations with more than one post per location were Washington D.C., McLean,  Arlington, and Quantico, which are all located in Northern Virginia. There are many entry job positions available for an aspiring analyst both in the government and working for federal contractors. Most of these entry positions have a low starting salary. Regarding average salary, our data set was largely representative and matched the average salary found in external sources. "

    "There were also several limitations throughout this project. When we looked at the 20 most common job duties,  punctuation was not excluded, therefore the words “analysis” and “analysis,” were treated as separate words.  The tool “Regular Expression” could have been used to exclude punctuation to allow these words to be treated as one.  Additionally, when we looked at the 20 most common job duties, the words “provide” and “providing” were categorized as separate words.  In the future, we could use advanced natural language processes, nltk, to convert each words to their root word.  For example, the words “providing,” “provides,” and “provided” would all be converted to the root word “provide.”  An additional limitation was that the line plot for “posted date” did not show the unrecorded months as zero.  This could lead to misinterpretation when reading the plot, because the it makes it look like there were job posts from every month."
